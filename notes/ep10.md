### Episode 10 
# Model Factories

Use a model factory to scaffold example data

``` php
public function definition(): array
{
    return {
        'first_name' => fake()->firstName(),
        'last_name' => fake()->lastName(),
        ''
    }
}
```

## Tinker commands
-  if you're confused about what to pass use `$ php artisan help make:<type>` 
- `$ php artisan tinker`
    - data is loaded into memory when this is executed
    - if data changes, restart `tinker`
    - it's a REPL
- `$ App\Models\User::factory()->create()`
    - adding `useFactory` as a trait adds methods; `create()` is one of them
    - `create()` optionally takes an integer as a parameter to create multiple records

## Adding a JobFactory
```php
namespace ...;

use ...\Factory;

class JobFactory extends Factory
    
    public function definition(): array
    {
        return {
            'title' => fake()->jobTitle(),
            'salary' => '50,000 USD',
        }
    }
```
- should be in the `namespace Database\Factories` by default after running `$ php artisan make:model -f Job`
- salary can be hard coded (unless it's a special case)

``` php
namespace ...;

use ...\Model;
use ...\hasFactory;

class Job extends Model {
    use HasFactory;

    protected $table = 'job';

    protected $fillable = ['title', 'salary']
}
```

### state method in a factory class

used to activate particular state
with `App\Models\User::factory()->unverified()` and the chain (?) `->create()`

```php
public function unverified():static
{
    return $this->state(fn(array $attributes => [
        'email_verified' => null,
    ]));
}
```

public function admin():static
{
    return $this 
}

## Adding Relationships

# Questions
- is it still called chaining in php?
- what is happening when we add static to the end of a function definition (like with `public function unverified():static`)?
